<h1>Welcome to your exercise!</h1>
<p>For this exercise we will be creating a weight metric converter.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We will take in a number of pounds(lbs) and convert it to kilograms(kg). Right now we only know
enough to do this one way, but later on we will learn how to add logic to this sort of problem.
 </p>
 <p></p>
 <p>To complete this exercise do the following:</p>
 <p>
 <ul>
   <li>Link the html file to your own .js file</li>
   <li>Use Javascript to accept a number of input in pounds(lbs)</li>
   <li>Then in your .js file convert this numbere to kilograms(*0.454)</li>
   <li>Afterwards report back in an alert what the weight is in kg</li>
   <li>Then log/write "Conversion Completed" to the console</li>
 </ul></p>
  </body>
